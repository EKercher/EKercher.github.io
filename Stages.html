    <p>With the exception of the Super Smash Bros.-original stages, all stages are ordered chronologically like the fighters are, based on their first appearances in the series (excluding the stages that were introduced in both versions of SSB4, which are listed among the stages introduced in the Wii U version). For the first time in the series, all stages are available immediately from the start, with none that need to be unlocked first. Additionally, due to 8-Player Smash no longer being a separate mode from regular Smash, all stages can be played with up to eight players, rather than just a select few as in SSB4. All stages have both a Battlefield form and Ω form. In its base game, Ultimate features 103 stages (305 if counting Battlefield forms and Ω forms separately). There is an additional stage exclusive to Training Mode, which replaces the Random Stage option on the stage selection screen for said mode.</p>
    
    <p> Ninety-six stages from previous games have returned overall: seven from Super Smash Bros., 19 from Super Smash Bros. Melee, 26 from Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and 44 from Super Smash Bros. 4 (18 from the 3DS version, 18 from the Wii U version, and eight from both versions), with an additional seven new stages (in the base game). All returning stages from Melee, Brawl, and for 3DS were visually updated to HD, as well as for Wii U stages receiving minor touch-ups to match the game's overall visual style, though Smash 64 stages retain their primitive polygonal aesthetic for nostalgia. In update 8.1.0, another new stage was added as a free download: Small Battlefield. This update also made it possible for any Super Smash Bros.-original stages to play music from any series, instead of just music from the Super Smash Bros. series. </p>
    
    <p>In update 3.0.0, the Stage Builder was added as a free download, and any custom stages made with it can be selected from the "Custom" tab.
    </p>

    <div class="col">
    <p>Five additional new stages were added to the game as part of the paid Fighters Pass Vol. 1 DLC, bringing the total number of stages up to 109 (321 if counting Battlefield forms and Ω forms separately). An additional six new paid DLC stages released as part of Fighters Pass Vol. 2, bringing the number up to 115 (339 if Battlefield and Ω forms are counted). Each of the eleven Challenger Packs contains one of these stages, alongside their corresponding fighters and music. The eleven paid DLC stages are Mementos, Yggdrasil's Altar, Spiral Mountain, King of Fighters Stadium, Garreg Mach Monastery, Spring Stadium, Minecraft World, Northern Cave, Cloud Sea of Alrest, Mishima Dojo, and Hollow Bastion, which released alongside Joker, Hero, Banjo & Kazooie, Terry, Byleth, Min Min, Steve, Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora, respectively.
    </p>
    
    <p>Only 15 stages featured in previous games are absent from Ultimate (excluding stages exclusive to single-player modes and previous forms of Battlefield, Big Battlefield, and Final Destination). These stages are: Planet Zebes and Sector Z from Smash 64; Icicle Mountain, Mushroom Kingdom, Poké Floats and Mute City from Melee; Rumble Falls and PictoChat from Brawl; Rainbow Road and Pac-Maze from Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS; and Jungle Hijinxs, Pyrosphere, Woolly World, Orbital Gate Assault, and Miiverse from Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. While Flat Zone from Melee and Flat Zone 2 from Brawl are also technically absent, Flat Zone X incorporates all elements of both of these stages. The World 1-2 version of Mushroomy Kingdom is also absent, as is the grayscale version of Dream Land GB.
