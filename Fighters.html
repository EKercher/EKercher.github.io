    <p> All 63 characters (65 if counting the Pokémon Trainer's Pokémon as three fighters) from all previous Smash Bros. games return as playable fighters. As well as the returning cast, the game features 23 newcomers (24 if counting Pyra and Mythra as two fighters). 11 of these characters are available in the base game, with the remaining 12 (13) characters available as downloadable content. In total, 74 characters (76) are playable in the base game and 86 (89) characters are playable overall, the most for any Smash Bros. game. Each character is numbered based on the order in which they first joined the series, with the exception of Echo Fighters (who share a number with the character they are based on) and Pokémon Trainer (whose Pokémon are numbered instead). </p>
    
    <p>An Inkling from the Splatoon series, with various Girl and Boy designs from the original Splatoon, was the first character confirmed to appear in the game as a new playable fighter. Ridley, a central villain from the Metroid series, was confirmed to be playable during E3 2018, with Meta Ridley as an alternate costume. Simon Belmont of the Castlevania series was announced as the game's first third-party newcomer along with his descendant and echo fighter, Richter Belmont. King K. Rool, arch-nemesis of the Kong family from the Donkey Kong series, was confirmed to be a playable newcomer as well, with his move-set drawing on his appearances as a boss in the Donkey Kong Country games. Isabelle from the Animal Crossing series, who previously appeared in Smash 4 as an Assist Trophy, makes her playable debut as the second Animal Crossing fighter. Finally, in the November Nintendo Direct, Incineroar from Pokémon Sun & Moon was announced as the title's last base roster newcomer.
    </p>
    
    <p>In addition, most full clones and one semi-clone are now labeled as "Echo Fighters" and are marked with an epsilon (ε) next to their fighter numbers, which they share with the characters they are based on. Returning characters Lucina and Dark Pit are given this title (as they are Echo Fighters of Marth and Pit, respectively), while new characters Princess Daisy, Richter, Chrom, Dark Samus, and Ken Masters are Echo Fighters of Princess Peach, Simon, Roy, Samus, and Ryu, respectively. Aside from an option allowing these characters to be displayed on the same slot as their counterpart on the character selection screen exclusively during Vs. Mode, Tourney, Custom Smash, Super Sudden Death, and Quickplay, there is no special distinction between most of them in-game, and the name is used mostly for marketing purposes.

    <p>A Piranha Plant from the Mario series touches new ground as the first mob character in Smash, and as an early purchase bonus DLC character, announced on November 1st, 2018, pre-released on January 29th, 2019 and fully released on February 1st, 2019. It was also confirmed that five more unique newcomers would be added as DLC by January 2020, all of whom are purchased in numbered 'Challenger Packs' that also contains a stage and several music tracks. These five Challenger Packs can be bought together as part of the Fighters Pass. For Fighters Pass Vol. 1, Joker from the Persona series is part of Challenger Pack 1 (announced on December 6th, 2018, one day before Ultimate's release; released on April 17th, 2019), an amalgamation of several Heroes from the Dragon Quest series is part of Challenger Pack 2 (announced on June 11th, 2019; released on July 30th, 2019), Banjo and Kazooie from their namesake series are part of Challenger Pack 3 (announced on June 11th, 2019; released on September 4th, 2019), Fatal Fury’s Terry Bogard is part of Challenger Pack 4 (announced on September 4th, 2019; released on November 6th, 2019), and Byleth from the Fire Emblem series is part of Challenger Pack 5 (announced on January 16th, 2020; released on January 28th, 2020).

    <p>During the September 4th, 2019 Nintendo Direct, after revealing Terry, it was announced that even more DLC fighters beyond the five in the Fighters Pass Vol. 1 was in development. Fighters Pass Vol. 2 was fully revealed during the January 16th, 2020 presentation revealing Byleth and includes 6 more Challenger Packs.

    <p>As in Smash 4, further "characters" exist as alternate costumes for preexisting characters. In this game, fourteen characters have such costumes: Alph is accessible as a playable character via Olimar's alternate costumes; the seven Koopalings are available as playable characters via Bowser Jr.'s alternate costumes; one of Pichu's costumes depicts the specific "Spiky-eared" Pichu variant; Alex, a Zombie, and an Enderman appear as Steve's alternate costumes; Pokémon Trainer, Wii Fit Trainer, Robin, Corrin, and Byleth each have opposite-gendered variants as alternate costumes; Pikachu possesses both an opposite-gendered variant and a costume depicting the specific "Cosplay" Pikachu variant; each of Villager's and Inkling's costumes represent different customization options for the character, including gender; the Hero has three other protagonists from across the Dragon Quest series as palette swaps; and the Ice Climbers swap the playable Ice Climber from Popo to Nana in half of their alternate costumes. Additionally, the Mii Fighters have alternate gender options depending on the created Mii used for them. However, none of these characters are treated separately in-game.
    </p>
    
    <p>Only the Original 8 characters from Super Smash Bros. and any DLC fighters that have been purchased are available from the start. Like in Smash 4, the Mii Fighters are also available via customization without needing to be unlocked traditionally but are still technically locked upon initial startup of the game. The rest of the cast must be unlocked; however, the unlocking process and conditions are much simpler than in past games. Fighters will challenge the player in ten-minute intervals after completing a basic activity, such as a battle, or by clearing Classic Mode with a prerequisite character, and can also be unlocked by being rescued in World of Light, rather than having unique unlock criteria for each character.
