      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ SPECIAL, Great Fray Smash Brothers Special),
    often shortened to "SSBU" or "Ultimate" (スマブラSP), is a crossover action fighting game for the

    and fully revealed on June 12th at E3 2018. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros.
    series (sixth if the two versions of Super Smash Bros. 4 are counted as separate titles). The

      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from both critics and players, with some
    critics calling it the best installment in the series. It received praise for its large amount
    of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay elements, although its online mode was 
    widely criticized. As of September 30, 2022, Ultimate had sold over 29.53 million copies
    worldwide, making it the best-selling Super Smash Bros. game and also the best-selling fighting
    game of all time, beating Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Street Fighter II, which previously held
    each title respectively. Its massive success has caused it to be nominated for, and win,
    multiple awards, including winning "Best Fighting Game" at The Game Awards 2019.
